# 2HS Chess: Improvements and Fixes

## Core Issues Fixed

### 1. Game Termination Detection

The main issue in the previous implementation was that the game termination logic didn't properly detect when a game had ended. This has been fixed with the following improvements:

- **Enhanced Game Over Detection**: Implemented a more robust method to check for game termination with proper prioritization
- **Detailed Game Over Reasons**: Added specific reason tracking to differentiate between checkmate, stalemate, and different types of draws
- **Position History Tracking**: Implemented proper history tracking for threefold repetition detection
- **Fifty-Move Rule**: Added detection for the fifty-move rule
- **Improved Insufficient Material Detection**: Enhanced detection for positions with insufficient material to checkmate

### 2. Knights Missing Issue

The previous implementation didn't include knights in the starting position. This has been fixed:

- **Standard Starting Position**: Changed the starting FEN to include knights in their standard positions
- **Updated Rules Description**: Updated the HTML template to include knights in the rules description
- **Added Knight-Specific Logic**: Updated the insufficient material detection to handle knights

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Python)

1. **Renamed the Main Class**:
   - Changed from `TwoHSNoKnightChessBoard` to `TwoHSChessBoard` to reflect the inclusion of knights

2. **Improved Position Tracking**:
   - Added proper position history tracking using FEN position strings
   - Implemented threefold repetition detection based on this history

3. **Structured Game Over Detection**:
   - Created a prioritized checking system for game termination:
     1. Checkmate (highest priority)
     2. Stalemate
     3. Draws (insufficient material, repetition, fifty-move rule)

4. **Enhanced API Responses**:
   - Added a `gameOverReason` field to API responses to communicate the specific reason for game termination
   - Enhanced error messages to provide clearer information to players

### Frontend (JavaScript)

1. **Updated Game Status Display**:
   - Modified the `updateGameStatus()` function to handle the new game termination conditions
   - Added logic to display different messages based on the specific reason for game termination

2. **Improved Move Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced error handling to properly update the game state when a move is invalid due to game termination
   - Added support for the new API response fields

3. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - Updated rule descriptions to include knights and their capabilities
   - Improved board highlights for valid moves

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Optimized Move Generation

- Improved the efficiency of the legal move generation by using lists instead of sets
- Added more efficient checking for duplicate moves
- Enhanced the would_be_in_check_after_move function for better performance

### 2. Better Draw Detection

- Added specific cases for insufficient material:
  - King vs King
  - King and Knight vs King
  - King and Bishop vs King

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback

- Added winner identification in checkmate messages
- Improved the formatting and clarity of game over messages
- Enhanced error handling to provide better feedback when moves fail

## Conclusion

The 2HS Chess implementation now correctly includes knights and properly detects all game termination conditions. The game state is synchronized between backend and frontend, providing a consistent experience to players. The enhanced move generation and position evaluation also provide a solid foundation for future AI integration.

These improvements bring the 2HS Chess implementation closer to the quality of established chess variant engines like Fairy-Stockfish, while maintaining the unique "King's Step" rule that defines this variant.
